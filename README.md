#html5-animations
These are a set of HTML5 animations that I created for my website as a JavaScript hobbyist. I use HTML5 canvas and plain JavaScript to produce that turned out be very nice.
They were originally published on my website - https://www.vivaxsolutions.com
The list includes the following:
1) A real analogue clock
2) An animated real-looking solar system
3) Animated beautiful heart, created with polar equations
4) An animated candle, created without external images
5) A percentage circle created without the aid of JQuery
6) An animated spring created without external images - just by manipulating sine curve
7) An interactive vernier calliper without external images
8) An animated bouncing ball
