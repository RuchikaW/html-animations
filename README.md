# html5-animations
These are a set of HTML5 animations that I created for my website as a JavaScript hobbyist. I use HTML5 canvas and plain JavaScript to produce that turned out very nice.
The list includes the following:
1) A real analogue clock
2) An animated real-looking solar system
3) Animated beautiful heart, created with polar equations
4) An animated candle, created without external images.
5) Percentage circle created without the aid of JQuery.
6) An animated spring created without external images - just by manipulating sine curve
7) An interactive vernier calliper is added
8) An animated bouncing ball is added
